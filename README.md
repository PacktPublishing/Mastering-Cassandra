# Mastering Cassandra [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Cassandra [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-cassandra-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784396381), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
As technology evolves, the constant upsurge of data creation leads to a continuous need for a more flexible, secure, and reliable manner of storage. Luckily, Cassandra is able to tackle this growing challenge. Cassandra is a flagship NoSQL database with decentralized, fault-tolerant, scalable, and low-cost features making it a core component of cloud computing systems. The more recent versions have greatly improved the security features, making it suitable for use in enterprise systems. When combined with Java and Spring frameworks, Cassandra can formulate a complete application stack thereby enabling efficient data management.

Mastering Cassandra is a power house of various advanced techniques that will help you become an expert in professional-level data management. This video course starts off from the essence of the web application architecture to setting up the environment with a single-node Cassandra cluster, and takes you to a level where you can build, implement, and secure web applications with ease.

In this step-by-step guide we will develop a real-time web portal application in Java and Cassandra. We'll start off by touching upon the major components of a Java web application and the development tools for the course, and then go deeper into the system analysis and designing of the CassandraWebTrader focusing on the Spring Framework projects. Through our journey to master Cassandra, we'll be working with core concepts and design patterns such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, model-view-controller, and enterprise integration patterns.

We'll build the CassandraWebTrader and implement all the typical functions of a web application as well as demonstrate the application of modeling-by-query techniques of Cassandra data modeling. In addition to this, weâ€™ll understand the techniques and design trade-offs of a real-world complex system. Finally, we will ace production configuration of CassandraWebTrader and discuss the most pertinent tasks in our daily operations, such as application monitoring and database backup.

By the end of this course, you will be armed with all the knowledge needed to efficiently design and develop Java web applications using Cassandra.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This is a step-by-step video course covering the typical tasks of developing a real-life web application. It starts from the architecture basics and proceeds incrementally with demonstrations and explanations to realize a paper design for a working application.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
ECC RAM should always be used, as Cassandra has few internal safeguards to protect against bit level corruption
The Cassandra heap should be no less than 2GB, and no more than 50% of your system RAM

m1.xlarge instances, which provide 1.6TB of local ephemeral spinning storage and sufficient RAM to run moderate workloads
i2 instances, which provide both a high RAM:CPU ratio and local ephemeral SSDs
m4.2xlarge / c4.4xlarge instances, which provide modern CPUs, enhanced networking and work well with EBS GP2 (SSD) storage
